**Made with AI through human collaboration**

Parts of this project were authored with assistance from AI and reviewed, curated, and integrated by humans. The human contributors retain authorship and responsibility for the final content and behavior of the project.

**Quick Start**

- Open `public/index.html` in your browser to run the app locally.
- Or serve the project with a simple static server, for example:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/public/index.html
```

or

```bash
npx serve public
```

**Status & Notes**

- The project is currently static (HTML/CSS/JS). Some Next.js files/configs remained from the original scaffold but the running site is static unless you run a Next.js server.
- If you want this repository to be a pure static project (remove Next.js scripts and deps), open an issue or request and I can help tidy `package.json` and configs.

**Contributing**

Contributions are welcome. By contributing you agree to license your changes under GPLv3+ as well. See `LICENSE` for details.
